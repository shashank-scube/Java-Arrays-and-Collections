# Java Arrays and Collections Examples

Welcome to the **Java Arrays and Collections Examples** repository! This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate various operations on arrays and collections in Java, such as adding, removing, sorting elements, and performing operations on lists, sets, maps, and queues.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `ArrayRemoveElement.java`
This program demonstrates how to remove an element from an array using a loop. It finds the specified element, shifts all subsequent elements one position to the left, and then sets the last position to a default value.

### 2. `ArraylistExample.java`
This program showcases operations on an `ArrayList`, including adding, removing, updating elements, iterating through the list, and checking the list's size and emptiness. It highlights common methods in `ArrayList`.

### 3. `HashsetExample.java`
This program illustrates the use of a `HashSet` to store unique elements. It includes methods to add, remove, check for an element, clear the set, and iterate over elements in the `HashSet`.

### 4. `MapExample.java`
This example demonstrates the usage of a `Map` (specifically `HashMap`). It covers adding key-value pairs, updating values, checking for the presence of keys or values, removing elements, and iterating through key-value pairs.

### 5. `QueueExample.java`
This program uses a `Queue` (implemented with `LinkedList`) and demonstrates typical queue operations like adding, peeking, and removing elements. It covers methods such as `offer()`, `poll()`, `peek()`, and `remove()`.

### 6. `Sorting.java`
This file provides examples of sorting an array using loops, along with the use of Java's built-in sorting methods. It showcases sorting in ascending and descending order.

### 7. `SampleArray.java`
This program demonstrates basic array operations, including initialization, populating arrays, accessing elements, and looping through arrays. It provides a foundation for working with arrays in Java.
